# Superpowers for Cursor

You have access to a powerful set of engineering skills and workflows. These are not optional suggestions - they are mandatory processes for reliable engineering.

## Mandatory Workflow Protocol

Before responding to ANY request that involves planning, coding, or debugging, you MUST:

1. **Check available workflows** in `.cursor/rules/`
2. **Check reference skills** in `docs/cursor-skills/`
3. **Trigger the appropriate rule** by referencing it
4. **Follow the workflow exactly**

## Core Rules

### 1. Workflow First
- **Design before Code:** Use `.cursor/rules/brainstorming-workflow.mdc`
- **Plan before Build:** Use `.cursor/rules/planning-workflow.mdc`
- **Debug Systematically:** Use `.cursor/rules/debugging-workflow.mdc`

### 2. Reference Skills
- Use `@docs/cursor-skills/` to load specific skills when needed
- Example: "I'm reading @docs/cursor-skills/test-driven-development.md to follow TDD protocols"

### 3. Explicit Task Tracking
- Use `todo_write` for ALL checklists found in skills
- Never track progress mentally
- Mark items complete only after VERIFICATION

### 4. Verification
- Never claim success without evidence
- Run tests/linters/commands and SEE output before claiming "fixed" or "done"
- See `docs/cursor-skills/verification-before-completion.md`

## Available Workflows (Triggers)

- **Brainstorming:** "brainstorm", "design", "idea" → `brainstorming-workflow.mdc`
- **Planning:** "plan", "implementation plan" → `planning-workflow.mdc`
- **Execution:** "execute", "implement" → `execution-workflow.mdc`
- **Code Review:** "review", "assess" → `code-review.mdc`
- **Debugging:** "debug", "fix", "error" → `debugging-workflow.mdc`
- **Context:** "context", "status" → `context-check.mdc`

## Common Rationalizations (STOP if you think these)

- "This is simple, I'll just write code" → **WRONG**. Use TDD.
- "I can verify it mentally" → **WRONG**. Run the command.
- "I'll update docs later" → **WRONG**. Update as you go.
- "The user knows what they want" → **WRONG**. Validate requirements first.

If a workflow exists for your task, you MUST use it.

# Brainstorming Workflow

Use this workflow to turn ideas into fully formed designs through collaborative questioning, exploration, and incremental validation.

## When to Use

- Designing new features
- Refining vague requirements
- Exploring architectural options
- **Before** writing any implementation code

## Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Understanding

1. **Context Check**: Read relevant files/docs to understand existing system.
2. **Scope & Constraints**: Ask questions to clarify:
   - MVP vs Production-ready?
   - Performance/Security constraints?
   - Target users?

### Phase 2: Exploring Approaches

1. **Propose Options**: Outline 2-3 approaches with trade-offs.
2. **Recommendation**: State your preferred approach and why.
3. **Selection**: Ask user to choose (using `ask_question` or text).

### Phase 3: Detailed Design

1. **Present in Sections**: Break design into 200-300 word chunks.
2. **Validate Incrementally**: Stop after each section to ask "Does this look right?"
3. **Refine**: Adjust based on feedback before moving to next section.

### Phase 4: Documentation & Handoff

1. **Document**: Write design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` (optional but recommended).
2. **Transition**: Ask if ready to move to implementation planning.

## Tool Usage

- Use `ask_question` for major decisions (Scope, Approach, Next Steps).
- Use `todo_write` to track progress through the 4 phases.

## Example Trigger

User: "I have an idea for a new caching system"
Response: "I'll use the brainstorming workflow to refine this. First, let me understand the scope..."

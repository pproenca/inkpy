# TDD Workflow

Use this workflow for all code changes.

## Reference
See `docs/cursor-skills/test-driven-development.md` for the full protocol.

## Workflow Steps

1. **RED**: Write a failing test.
   - Verify it fails for the right reason.
   - `run_terminal_cmd` to confirm failure.

2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass.
   - Don't over-engineer.
   - `run_terminal_cmd` to confirm pass.

3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up.
   - Verify tests still pass.

## Critical Rules
- **Test First**: Code without a failing test is forbidden.
- **Watch Failure**: You must see the test fail.
- **Minimal Code**: Only write what the test requires.

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)
- Testing mocks instead of real behavior.
- Writing tests after code.
- Skipping verification steps.
